time
====

"Returns the number of milliseconds since the Arduino board began running the current program. 
This number will overflow (go back to zero), after approximately 50 days." [1]

speed is distance over time, so we need to get the time somewhere right?
Arduino microcontroller provides with a time library so that you can measure
and use it.

This tutorial provides a method to read and handle the time using arduino uno board
