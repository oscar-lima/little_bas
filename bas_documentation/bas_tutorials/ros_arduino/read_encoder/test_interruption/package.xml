		test interruption in the arduino uno board, wire a button to pin 3 and watch
		the led blinking, this is due to the fact that every change from low to high
		in the pin3 of the microcontroller (arduino board) will interrupt whatever
		loop function is doing and it will attend the blink function. After finishing
		with blink function it will then continue what it was previously doing.
