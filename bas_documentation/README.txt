About little bas project
========================

Little bas is a differential drive robot constructed with an arduino board and arduino motor shield.
It comes with examples on how to step by step get familiar with it.
It aims to teach robotics at a low leve, which means that any student (bachelor and master) should be 
able to follow and learn from it.

Documentation has been generated in form of wikis, pdf, tutorials, etc.

We selected the ROS (robot operating system) indigo platform and all the code has been tested under ubuntu 14.04 long term support.

Although the code might work in other platforms that we do not know and is up to the user to test it, what we can
be sure is that it does not work under ros hydro.

please make sure you read the complete pdf documentation inside this folder for detail reference on how this
robot works.

Enjoy and good luck!
